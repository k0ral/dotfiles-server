;
; SimpleID identity file.
;
; This file contains all the data associated with an identity.  It should
; always be named username.identity, where username is the user name to be used
; when logging into SimpleID.
;
; In this file, if a value contains non-numeric characters, you will need to
; surround it with quotation characters.
;

;
; The OpenID Identifier associated with this identity.  This is typically a
; URL, although the OpenID specifications allow the use of URIs and even XRIs.
;
; Relying parties must be able to resolve the identity to obtain the address
; of this SimpleID installation.
;
; WARNING: If you change the OpenID Identifier after you have used it in
; SimpleID, you will need to delete all files named 'identity-*.cache' in the
; cache directory.
;
; Examples:
;    http://example.com/
;    http://example.com:8888/
;    http://example.com/myopenid
;    https://example.com:8080/myopenid
;
identity="http://88.163.232.134/id/chahine/"

;
; The password associated with this identity.  This password is hashed using
; the MD5 algorithm.
;
; There are various tools available which will give you the MD5 hash of any
; given string.  If you have access to the command-line interface of PHP, you
; can run the following command to give you the hash.
;
; php -r "print md5('example password');"
;
; Alternatively, you can upload the following PHP code to your web server, then
; read off the hash with your web browser.  (This is recommended only if your
; web server supports secure uploads (e.g. SFTP) and HTTPS, you that your
; password is not sent over the Internet as clear text.)
;
; <?php header('Content-Type: text/plain'); print md5('example password'); ?>
;
; Alternatively, Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) has other resources
; on generating this hash.
